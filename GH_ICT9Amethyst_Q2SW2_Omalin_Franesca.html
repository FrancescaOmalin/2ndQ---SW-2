<td align='center'><b>Pomeranians</b></td>
<td align="center"><p>Pomeranian, byname Pom, breed of toy dog that can be traced back—like the related Keeshond, Samoyed, and Norwegian Elkhound—to early sled-dog ancestors. The breed is named for the duchy of Pomerania, where in the early 19th century it is said to have been bred down in size from a 30-pound (13.5-kg) sheepdog. Characteristically spirited but docile, the Pomeranian is a compactly built dog with a foxlike head and small erect ears. Its long coat, especially full on the neck and chest, may be any of a variety of colours, including white, black, brown, and reddish brown. The Pomeranian stands about 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18 cm) tall at the withers and weighs about 3 to 7 pounds (1.5 to 3 kg).</p></td>

<td align='center'><b>Dachshunds</b></td>
<td align="center"><p>Dachshund, (German: “badger dog”) dog breed of hound and terrier ancestry developed in Germany to pursue badgers into their burrows. The Dachshund is a long-bodied, characteristically lively dog with a deep chest, short legs, tapering muzzle, and long ears. Usually reddish brown or black-and-tan, it is bred in two sizes—standard and miniature—and in three coat types—smooth, longhaired, and wirehaired. The standard Dachshund stands about 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23 cm) tall at the withers and weighs 16 to 32 pounds (7 to 14.5 kg). The miniature is shorter and weighs no more than 11 pounds (5 kg).</p></td>

<td align='center'><b>Shih Tzus</b></td>
<td align="center"><p>Shih Tzu, Tibetan dog breed developed from the Pekingese and the Lhasa Apso. Listed in the toy group by the American Kennel Club, the Shih Tzu, called in Chinese shih-tzu kou (“lion dog”; Pinyin shizi gou), is a longhaired, characteristically active and alert little dog standing about 10 inches (25 cm) tall at the withers (between the dog’s shoulder blades) and weighing 9 to 16 pounds (4 to 7 kg). It is longer than it is tall and is sturdily built and short-legged, with a short muzzle, hanging ears, and a heavily haired tail carried over its back. Its dense coat, which may be a variety of colours, falls over its eyes and forms a beard and whiskers on the face. The breed was developed in Tibet more than 1,000 years ago and was revealed to the outside world in the 1930s. The Shih Tzu was formally recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1969.</p></td>
